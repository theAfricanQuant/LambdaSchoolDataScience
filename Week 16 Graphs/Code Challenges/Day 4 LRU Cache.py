"""
Implement the set and get methods we'll need for our LRU cache implementation by leveraging the doubly-linked list class you worked on yesterday (provided).

A LRU cache is a data structure built atop a doubly-linked list that stores key-value pairs in list nodes. It maintains the condition that the head node of the list is the oldest key-value pair, and the tail node is the newest. It also needs to be able to set and get new nodes in constant time. 

Whenever a node is accessed, either via reading an already-existing node, or writing a new node to the cache, that node is moved to the tail of the list as the 'most-recently accessed' node. 

So our LRU cache keeps track of most-recently accessed key-value pairs, up to a storage limit. Once that limit has been reached, if a new pair is to be added to the list, the oldest (the head) node in the list needs to be evicted to make room for the newest pair. 

A few gotchas you may run into when implementing this class in Python:

1. If you want to check if a key is in a dictionary, you cannot attempt to access the key-value pair by the key and then check if the pair is truthy. For example, you can't do this for some key that is not in the dictionary:

node = self.storage[key]
if node:
  ...

This will return a KeyError. Instead, check if a key is in a dictionary by doing:

if key in self.storage:
  node = self.storage[key]
  ...

2. Use a Python tuple to represent a key-value pair. Note however that tuples are immutable; you cannot mutate an already-existing tuple. If you want to update a tuple, you'll need to create a new copy.
